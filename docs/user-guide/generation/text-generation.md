# Text Generation

Text generation is the task of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input prompt.
This can include generating sentences, paragraphs, or even entire articles. 

Text generators use large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on vast amounts of text data to understand language patterns, grammar, and context.
